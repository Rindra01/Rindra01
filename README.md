### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ‘‰I'm Rindra, a student in marine sciences interrested in digital world, which is why I am currently a SAYNA apprentice.

-My research focuses on coral reef health, but I'm also exploring the fields of biotechonology and blue-green economics.ðŸŽ¯ I am involved in various projects aimed at community development, optimizing sustainable development for all.

-On the other hand, I'm interested in code and hope to become a developer later on, but for the moment I'm specializing in the Wordpress path. I'm looking for a way to merge my community projects with digital ones.

-I am open to all that is capacity and knowledge development, and I am also looking to collaborate with an organization that shares my vision.
